# Committee Charters

This is where we keep and maintain all of our committee charters for IndieDAO.

**Steps to udpate a committee charter:**
1. Create a branch of this repository.
1. Commit changes to your branch.
2. Create a PR with your changes.
3. Post your PR to the DAO in the #governance Discord channel for a 72 hour review window.
5. After review, create a Snapshot proposal for 7 days (or enlist help by the core team). 
7. Post your Snapshot voting to the Discord governance channel.
8. Upon passing vote, Core team will merge your PR upon approval by the DAO.
